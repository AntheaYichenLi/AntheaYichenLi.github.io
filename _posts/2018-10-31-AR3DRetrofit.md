Existing techniques for stability analysis and stabilization solutions for priceless art pieces or historical artifacts require complicated hardware setup and time-consuming support design process. In this paper, we present a novel approach to objects stabilization by integrating Augmented Reality (AR) technology in the traditional stabilization pipeline. Our model solves the 3D model stabilization problem by utilizing AR-enabled real-time photogrammetry to obtain a 3D mesh of the object. Based on the reconstruction, we conduct a stability analysis in real-time to be visualized using AR for users to set their preference on the retrofitting mesh to be designed and generated. Our model constructs a support structure in real-time subjected to user-specified preferences on the minimum tipping angle, maximum amount of support material used and so on. Finally, our model will generate a properly-scaled mesh ready to be 3D printed and attached to the sculpture or model in question for added stability. We demonstrate that the 3D-printed support structure generated by our model provides the same amount of stability as the the existing efforts in sculpture and model stabilization but is a lot faster, less costly, and more convenient than the state-of-the-art system

Side note comment: applied a bug fix similar to [this commit](https://github.com/Atlas7/atlas7.github.io/commit/6659f4a47f6ec66987adb0f683a9c6f3842252ae#diff-818954a41dbfb01af70050a459c603b9) to ensure code snippet does not collapse unexpectly upon clicking on it. This issue is tracked [here](https://github.com/jarrekk/Jalpc/issues/97).
